I do not collect any data.
This is a static website, this means there is no database attached and nothing can be tracked by me.
I also do not collect any cookies, nor is there any third party cookies involved.

Github.com, the place where I host this website, does collect the IP-adress of any visitor.
I have no influence on this and neither the financial resources to avoid this free hoster.

If privacy is important enough for you to check out this page, you probably know how to use a VPN service and avoid this problem alltogether.


Thank you for your attention.
