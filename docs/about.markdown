I am Aron, currently studying Cognitive Science in Germany.
I dream of having me own bar one day and am working on the perfect recipe for homebrew beer.
I am also passionate about 3D Printing and all of its curious applications.
I am thoroughly frustrated that I have to pay for the plastic I use for printing while I throw the packaging of my food away, being the exact same thing.
Plastic waste is no joke, we know that by now and I consider it my personal contribution to the cause to help advance small scale, decentralized recycling.

Since I donâ€™t want the hassle of maintaining multiple pages for different things, I misuse the page for other topics too. So be prepared to find updates about all kinds of my latest endeavours.
Happy rummaging!
